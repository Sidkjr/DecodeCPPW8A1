int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    c += i;
}

Ans: For the above code,

    The is no special condition here that can change the no.of operations 
    i.e the loop will run 'n' times 
    since we are incrementing i's value by only 1 
    and only stopping till i reaches n.

    so the time complexity will be, O(n).
