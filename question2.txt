int c = 0;
for(int i = n; i > 1; i /= i) {
c++;
}


Ans: For the above code,

    The no.of operations will be 1 because,
    we are changing ith value by dividing it with itself, resulting it to 1. And since we always follow 
    the for loop condition(i > 1), the loop terminates.

    Hence, time complexity for the above code is O(1).
