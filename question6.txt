int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < i; j++){
        c++;
    }
}

Ans: For the above code,

    There is a loop within a loop and for every ith iteration, 
    there will be j operations, and since the ith iteration loop 
    only validates using n in the condition,

    the time complexity here is O(n*n) or simply O(n^2).
